page – notes</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Below is an explanation of
some of the subjective methods used when determining the most likely tournament
winner when definitive records such as written evidence are not available. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Arial'>First place</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>All winners of trophies and
tournaments are known and confirmed by evidence, except for the following
tournaments: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-family:Arial'>Allegro in 1989 and 1992, and </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-family:Arial'>Lightning in 1990, 1991 and 1992.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>It was generally assumed
around the club in 1993 when I first joined that Joe Tarnawski was virtually
unbeatable by other club members at Allegro and Lightning over the course of an
entire tournament. He entered all tournaments from 1989 to 1992, and when lists
of entrants are available (1991 and 1992) he is clearly likely to win. No
existing member was able to boast of winning a Lightning or Allegro tournament
that Joe had appeared in. On this basis he appears in the Champions list as
winner of these tournaments. <br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Second and
Third placings</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>All second and third place
getters are known since 1993. <br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The following second and
third place getters were best guessed using available information when a
definitive record (such as written evidence) was not available:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Allegro &amp; Lightning</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Minor placings were estimated
as follows: </span></p>

P Kirkman and M Winn were the best players at the club behind J Tarnawski. P Kirkman
was the better Allegro player (see 1994 result) while M&nbsp;Winn was at least
the equal of Kirkman at lightning at this time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Best All-Rounder Trophy</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Current scoring scales used
for the BAR Trophy were applied to years where most tournament results were
known: 1985, 1986, 1989 and 1992. For 1988 no tournament results have survived
beyond the winners names, however a list called the ‘Twin Clubs tournament
ladder’ survives. Twin Clubs was a term used for a competition linking the
tournaments of The Gap Chess Club and the Northside Chess Club (then known as Nundah
Chess Club). The 1988 BAR Trophy placings are based on the highest placed
players known to be Gap members at the time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Handicap </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>For 1989 and 1992 placings
are based on the Handicap tournaments for which the original handicaps awarded
are unknown. 1990 placings are based on the One Hour tournament for that year.
In each of these cases it has been estimated which player most surpassed
expected performance, based on their rating at the time and points gained in
the tournament. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>1985 and 1986</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The 1985 second place getter
for the BAR Trophy and Handicap is known from Jan 1986 Committee Club Minutes. Further
details of 1985 results are known from a summary of the BAR Trophy results
compiled close to the end of 1985. The 1986 second place getter for the
Handicap is known from other records (D Grice 5; P Cronin 4½).</span></p>
