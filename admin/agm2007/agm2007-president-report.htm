<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:
Arial'>President's Report</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>17 November 2007</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The year 2007 has
been a moderately successful year for The Gap Chess Club. Attendances have dipped
through the year, although there has been a revival as we head into the warmer
months. Club membership remains quite high with 30 financial members on the
books, including 7 junior players. On a positive note, many of our current
members are enthusiastic and involved and regularly attend regardless of
whether there is tournament play. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The general success
of the chess club can be attributed to several factors:</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>a strong
     inclusive social atmosphere on Friday nights</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>a structured
     tournament schedule </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>the commitment
     of the players who attend on Friday nights, and</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>the commitment
     to administration duties by those on the committee.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The committee for
2007 initially comprised of seven but suffered from two members leaving the
club for geographical reasons and another resigning for work reasons. This caused
the clubâ€™s administration to be left largely in the hands of the president and
the treasurer. It is hoped that the 2008 committee will consist of those who
are able to regularly attend the club during 2008.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Others outside
the committee also contribute enormously to the club and should be
acknowledged. Ray Adams often opens up the club and closes it as well. He will
usually be seen volunteering to do the unpopular job of cleaning up at the end
of night. I would like to thank Ray for his contribution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Another task that
Ray and others perform is welcoming new players. I encourage our members,
particularly the experienced players, to engage with new arrivals to our club,
whether over the chessboard or in conversation. Often the first night
experience will determine whether someone comes back and becomes a regular club
member. Please take the time to chat with new members and have a few games with
them if this is possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Publicity is important
to gaining new members who ensure the continued health of the club. Anecdotal
evidence shows that most of our new members are attracted to the club through
the <i>Western Echo</i> chess column and our club website. Tony Howes wrote the
chess column during most of 2007 and performed the task admirably. Thanks to Tony
for his efforts. Further ideas for promoting the club are welcome, particularly
if you are prepared to undertake some of the legwork to carry them out!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>In conclusion,
2007 has been another good year for the club, and I look forward to another
good year for the club in 2008.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>
