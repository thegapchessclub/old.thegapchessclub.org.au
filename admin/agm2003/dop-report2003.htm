<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
have been DOP at The Gap CC since 1995 and believe that 2003 has been the best
year so far in regards to participation and commitment from the players. There
have been very few withdrawals from tournaments and the number of forfeited
games must be at a record low. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
recently concluded One Hour would have to best tournament that I have run at
the club, and its success is due to the players doing what they should –
showing up on the night at the appointed time, or contacting their opponent in
a timely fashion when this is not possible. There were 88 games played in the
tournament out of a possible 92, with only 4 awarded on forfeit, and only one
of these when a player failed to show up or notify the opponent. This was further
impressive as the 2003 Hour tournament was the second largest in the history of
the club, only behind the monumental 18 player round-robin in the 1983 Flood
Cup which contained 107 games (but took all year to run!).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Major
tournaments conducted during 2003 include the following:</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Flood
     Cup (including Handicap Trophy)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>One
     Hour tournament (including Maiden Trophy)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Allegro
     tournament, and</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Lightning
     tournament.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>In
addition to these I was organiser and arbiter for 6 junior tournaments through
the year, conducting these on a once-every-4-weeks basis. As in previous years
these were a success, although it was disappointing to notice a drop in numbers
through the year, caused by the problems surrounding the coaching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
club has been involved in interclub tournaments against Samford Valley CC and
Northside CC. These nights were quite successful, and attracted special
interest from players eager to play serious games but not able to make the
commitment to play in a full tournament. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
purchase of Digital Game Timers (DGTs) during the year is timely, and will
assist the DOP’s task of making those difficult judgments in tight finishes. It
is also hoped that our players will become accustomed to the use of DGTs,
assisting them should they enter weekend tournaments. To take advantage of the
DGT’s incremental time function, there are proposals before this year’s AGM
which aim to amend the time controls for some tournaments.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>In
2004 I foresee a similar programme to this year, and welcome any suggestions
for how the programme can be improved. The tournament schedule for 2004 should
be available during December, with the first 2004 tournament to be the
Lightning run over 6 weeks commencing in the first week of the New Year. The
2004 prize night is scheduled for </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Once
again thanks to all club members for making 2003 a successful year for the
club. </span></p>
