Arial'>Junior Club Report </span></b><b><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:18.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>                  </span></b><span
 lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>22nd October 2003</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The junior
section of The Gap Chess Club has had many ups and downs over the past ten
years of its existence. This has been due to the variations in attendance
patterns which are often unpredictable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>During the second
half of 2003 the club’s junior section has been in decline due to problems
associated with providing coaching to all of the juniors. This has been as a
result of one of the coaches having ongoing health problems. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Due to an
alarming drop in the number of children attending, a meeting to determine the
future of the junior chess club was held on </span><span
 lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>17 October 2003</span><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-family:Arial'>. It was decided at this meeting that the club will
continue to operate with Max Leskiewicz providing coaching to both groups until
the end of 2003. Previously the arrangement has been for Max to instruct the
more advanced children, while Nikki Jones looked after the beginners. I will
still organise a tournament night approximately one week in four.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Max has advised
me that he will be able to continue teaching until at least the end of the
first term in 2004. At this time he will assess how he can fit in chess with
his other commitments. On the second Friday night of first term 2004 there will
be a meeting of parents and supporters to discuss how the junior club will be
run during 2004. Of paramount importance will be the encouragement of parents
to be more involved with the administrative side of the juniors, including the
organisation of events such as the Western Suburbs tournament.</span></p>
