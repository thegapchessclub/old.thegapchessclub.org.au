<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:
Arial'>President's Report</span></b><b><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:18.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>                           </span></b><span
 lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>22nd October 2003</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>This year has
been a successful year for The Gap Chess Club. Attendances at the senior club
have been higher than in recent years. Participation and interest in our
tournaments has also been higher than in any of the past five years. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The success of
the adult chess club can be attributed to several factors:</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>a strong
     inclusive social atmosphere on Friday nights</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>a structured
     tournament schedule </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>the commitment
     of the players to attend on Friday nights, and</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>the commitment
     to administration duties by those on the committee.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The club has seen
several new members this year, and with better publicity may be able to attract
more. At least two have joined as a result of the Western Echo chess column,
while several others have come to the club after visiting our website. However
there is always room for improvement and any suggestions for (and commitment to
implementing!) further ways to publicise the club are welcome</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The club’s junior
section has been in decline during the second half of 2003. Measures have been
taken to arrest this decline (see Junior Report for full details). The juniors
will continue to meet during school term until the end of the year, and a
meeting of parents and supporters will occur on the second Friday of Term One
2004 to map the way forward for 2004.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Finally, the club
continues to remember the contribution of Doug Foster who passed away in
January this year. Doug was a pillar of the club, and a tireless worker for </span><span
  lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Queensland</span><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-family:Arial'> chess in general, and his presence at the club is
sorely missed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>
