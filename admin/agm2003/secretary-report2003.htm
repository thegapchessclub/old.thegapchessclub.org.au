 lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>30<sup>th</sup> September, 2003</span><span

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>In August this
year Paul Evans, the secretary elected at last years AGM, advised that he was
unable to carry out his duties and Stuart Wilson was elected acting secretary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The club was
saddened in January this year by the death of Doug Foster our tireless worker
for our club, as well as chess in </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:
  Arial'>Australia</span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>During the year
your Management committee held 3 meetings with an average attendance of 5
members.  At these meetings all activities of the club were examined and
reports from the Secretary, Treasurer, DOP, Equipment Officer and Junior
Representative were received and approved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Publicity of the
club’s activities has been largely due to Andrew Robinson who set up and
maintains the club’s web site. He also submits text for the Chess-t-Minute
article for the Western Echo, a local paper in The Gap area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>This year, our
Junior Section has suffered considerable decline due to the health difficulties
of one of our coaches. This has resulted in the beginner section being without
a coach on numerous occasions. In addition to this the traditional tournament
The Gap Open was not held this year and the cadet section of this tournament
has always been a good source of publicity for the juniors..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The annual
general meeting this year gives members an opportunity to elect new office
bearers and provide a strong enthusiastic club for 2003.</span></p>
