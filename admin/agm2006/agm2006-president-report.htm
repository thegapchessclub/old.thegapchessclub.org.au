<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:
Arial'>President's Report</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>31 October 2006</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The year 2006 has
been another successful year for The Gap Chess Club. Participation and interest
in our tournaments has reached an all-time high. The number of club members now
stands at 30 which must be close to a record level of membership</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The success of
the chess club can be attributed to several factors:</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>a strong
     inclusive social atmosphere on Friday nights</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>a structured
     tournament schedule </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>the commitment
     of the players to attend on Friday nights, and</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>the commitment
     to administration duties by those on the committee.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>As has been the
case since 2004, the committee has continued to meet informally, consulting via
email, or by meeting on a club evening. Care has been taken to ensure that
decisions made by the committee have the consensus of all committee members. The
committee for 2006 worked very well together and I would like to thank fellow
committee members Stuart Wilson, Debbie Jenkins, Mark Taylor and Marty Chadwick
for their work, valued input to decisions, and assistance in running the club.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Others outside
the committee also contribute enormously to the club and should be
acknowledged. Ray Adams often opens up the club and closes it as well. He will
usually be seen volunteering to do the unpopular job of cleaning up at the end
of night. I would like to thank Ray for his contribution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Another task that
Ray and others perform is the welcoming of new players. I encourage our members,
particularly the experienced players, to engage with new arrivals to our club,
whether over the chessboard or in conversation. Often the first night
experience will determine whether someone comes back and becomes a regular club
member. Please take the time to chat with new members and have a few games with
them if this is possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The CAQ has had
an eventful year during 2006. Through this turbulent time The&nbsp;Gap&nbsp;CC worked
successfully to maintain a pro-active and cordial relationship with the CAQ. Where
possible, we seek to have our input taken into account when key decisions are
made by the CAQ. When our club’s committee makes a decision in relation to a
CAQ matter, it will be communicated to the club’s CAQ delegate who then
on-forwards this advice to the CAQ. Without our association with the CAQ, our
tournaments would not be ACF rated, so this is always an imperative in our
maintaining our link to the state body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:
Arial'>President's Report (continued)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Publicity is important
to gaining new members who ensure the continued health of the club. Anecdotal
evidence shows that most of our new members are attracted to the club through
the <i>Western Echo</i> chess column and our club website. Marty Chadwick wrote
the chess column during most of 2006 and performed the task admirably, as well
as maintaining the games pages on the website. Thanks to Marty for his efforts.
Further ideas for promoting the club are welcome, particularly if you are
prepared to undertake some of the legwork to carry them out!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Stuart Wilson has
been a member of The Gap Chess Club since 1981. From 1982 to 2006 he has
continuously served on the club’s committee, performing the roles of secretary
(1982-1985); vice-president (1986-2006); treasurer (effectively 1993 to 2005);
and acting president (July-November 1992). I would like to extend on behalf of
the club my thanks for his tireless efforts and fastidiousness in making sure “the
job was done right”. Without Stuart it is probable that the club would not
exist now on such firm footing. In particular he was solid during the rocky
times from 1990 to 1993 when club membership was at an all time low. He also
was on hand to take over the reigns when a succession of treasurers resigned
mid-term during the 1990s. And during the 2000s when the club membership could
not provide a successor, through a sense of duty to the club he continued as treasurer
several years beyond when he wanted to retire from this role. On a personal
note I would like to thank him for his friendship and companionship. His sense
of humour and commonsense has helped enormously when dealing with some of the
more eccentric personalities and situations that chess can throw at an
administrator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>In conclusion to
my report, 2006 has been another successful year for The Gap Chess Club Inc. and
I do not anticipate any great changes to the shape and structure of activities
at the club during 2007.</span></p>
