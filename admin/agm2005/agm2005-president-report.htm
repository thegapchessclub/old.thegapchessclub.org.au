<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>30
 October 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>This
year has been a successful year for The Gap Chess Club. During 2005 attendances
at the senior club have been maintained at the satisfactory level of 2003 and
2004. Participation and interest in our tournaments has remained high. As a
result the club has emerged at the end of the financial year (ending </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>30/09/2005</span><span
lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>) with a small increase
in balance on the previous year, ensuring that the club can maintain its
services to members. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
success of the chess club can be attributed to several factors:</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>a
     strong inclusive social atmosphere on Friday nights</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>a
     structured tournament schedule </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>the
     commitment of the players to attend on Friday nights, and</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>the
     commitment to administration duties by those on the committee.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
committee began to operate more informally during 2004 and this continued in
2005. Prior to 2004 the committee met regularly on a monthly basis and
conducted formal meetings at a location away from the club’s premises, often at
Stuart Wilson’s residence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Following
the resignation of John Curran as equipment officer in January, the day to day
running of the club has usually fallen to four people – Debbie Jenkins, Marty
Chadwick, Stuart Wilson and myself. As we have communicated freely and often
with each other, there has not been a pressing need for formal meetings. In
2005 only one formal meeting was held, to decide the club’s course of action
when we discovered Room D1 had been renovated by the school without advising us,
and would no longer be suitable for chess. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Whether
the club will continue the practice of deciding club matters informally among
the committee members will depend of the composition of the committee for 2006.
It is healthy for the club to have broad participation in the administrative
duties within the club and I welcome any who wish to join the committee. It should
also be acknowledged that there are other ways to assist the club, an example
of which is the way Ray happily does more than his share of the cleaning up at
the end of most Friday nights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Publicity
is important to gaining new members and the main way this occurs is through the
Western Echo chess column and our club website. Marty Chadwick has taken over
the writing of the chess column during this year and has performed admirably in
this task, as well as maintaining the games pages on the website. Further ideas
for promoting the club are welcome, particularly if you are prepared to
undertake some of the legwork to carry them out!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>In
summary, 2005 has been another successful year for The Gap Chess Club Inc. and
I do not anticipate any great changes to the shape and structure of activities
at the club during 2006.</span></p>
