<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>23 October 2005</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Due to the
limitations of our club’s webserver, it has proved impossible to upgrade the
functionality of the games page on our website. For now, the ability for the
user to move pieces for post-game analysis is a pipe dream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The games page
received 63 submissions this year which is a fantastic participation rate over
our two major tournaments and it made for some memorable moments which will add
to the club’s already rich history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The overall
appeal of the club website was able to attract the attention of two chess
players in </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>America</span><span
lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>, and they paid us a visit during their
time in </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Australia</span><span
lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>. Special thanks goes to Andrew for
maintaining the appeal of The Gap Chess Club on the internet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Our free column
in the Western Echo publication continued over the last 12 months. The aim of
the article, for the readers who aren’t aware of our presence on the web, is to
portray a club that has personalities, history, and drama over the chessboard.
The reader is also presented with an interesting chess puzzle and a quote of
the month to ponder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Our interclub
friendlies with </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Samford</span><span

  style='font-family:Arial'>Valley</span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:
Arial'> and Northside chess clubs continued this year with The Gap again winning
all three encounters. These results may have led to the challenge proposed by
Bullwinkle, a chess club founded by Jacob Edwards. Due to the distance involved
however, the Gap declined the invitation.</span></p>
