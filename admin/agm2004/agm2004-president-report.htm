<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:
Arial'>President's Report</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>8 November 2004</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>This year has
been a successful year for The Gap Chess Club. During 2004 attendances at the
senior club have been maintained at the satisfactory level of 2003.
Participation and interest in our tournaments has remained high. As a result
the club has emerged at the end of the financial year (ending </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>30/09/04</span><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-family:Arial'>) with an increased balance on the previous year,
ensuring that the club can maintain its services to members. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The success of
the adult chess club can be attributed to several factors:</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>a strong
     inclusive social atmosphere on Friday nights</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>a structured
     tournament schedule </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>the commitment
     of the players to attend on Friday nights, and</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>the commitment
     to administration duties by those on the committee.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The club has retained
most of the new members it gained in 2003 and has welcomed further new members
in 2004. Publicity is important to gaining new members and the main way this
occurs is through the Western Echo chess column and our club website. To
achieve further publicity the club requires commitment from individuals who are
able to write articles for newspapers (they don’t have to be long) and contact
local schools.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>In last year’s
report to the AGM it was noted that the club’s junior section had been in
decline during the second half of 2003. This decline continued during 2004 and
the efforts of new coach </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Patrick</span><span
 lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'> </span><span lang=EN-AU
  style='font-family:Arial'>Byrom</span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:
Arial'> were unable to arrest this decline. The result is that the junior club
will close at the end of 2004. This has primarily been due to the lack of
enthusiasm from the parents to be involved in the organisation of the junior
club, but can also be attributed to the lack of a coaching presence in the
local schools. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>I believe that to
resurrect the junior club what is required is an enthusiastic individual (or group
of individuals) who can either perform or facilitate:</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>working and
     being involved with the schools (through coaching), </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>attending to
     the coaching on Friday nights </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>managing the
     organisational aspect (collection of moneys and writing letters to parents
     and rosters).</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The senior club
has been successful and I do not anticipate any great changes to the shape and
structure of activities at the club during 2005.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>
