<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>10 November 2004</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>This
year’s tournament programme has again been successful with all tournament
attracting a good level of participation. Tournaments commenced and were
completed close to schedule. The Flood Cup and One Hour tournaments were
submitted for rating with the Australian Chess Federation (ACF) so it is
expected that all players who competed in these tournaments will have an
official ACF rating in the December 2004 list.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Major
tournaments conducted during 2004 include the following:</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Flood
     Cup (including Handicap Trophy)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>One
     Hour tournament (including Maiden Trophy)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Allegro
     tournament (in progress)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Lightning
     tournament.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>In
addition to these I was organiser and arbiter for three other regular tournaments
which are played at a more relaxed pace and are enjoyable to all:</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>45
     minute tournament (held in Dec2003/Jan 2004) </span></li>

     Night tournament (Handicap Lightning format) </span></li>

     successful first year). </span></li>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
club again played Samford Valley CC and Northside CC in home and away fixtures
during the past 12 months. Apart from the Samford away game in which only three
members showed up to represent The Gap, these nights have been successful, and have
been a forum in which players can play serious games without having to be
concerned about loss of rating points and tournament standing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
transition to incremental time controls via the use of Digital Game Timers (DGTs)
has been a success, with few problems encountered once players become
accustomed to setting the clocks themselves. As with any change there have been
mutterings from arch-conservatives. However from an arbiter’s point of view most
of the ‘incidents’ during the year occurred during the Lightning and One Hour
tournaments, both of which do not use increments. Mindful that we need to cater
to all, I support retaining guillotine finishes for some of our tournaments,
and leave it to the members to decide how far we should go with spreading the
use of what one member recently described as the ‘evil’ and ‘bestial system of
increments’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>In
2005 I foresee a similar programme to this year, and welcome any suggestions as
to how the programme can be improved. The tournament schedule for 2005 should
be available during December, with the first 2005 tournament to be the
Lightning run over 6 weeks commencing on </span><span

the 45 Minute tournament for 2004 will again be held over the summer break (Dec
2004/Jan 2005). The 2004 prize night is scheduled for </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Friday 21 January 2005</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Once
again thanks to all club members for making 2004 a successful year for the
club. </span></p>
