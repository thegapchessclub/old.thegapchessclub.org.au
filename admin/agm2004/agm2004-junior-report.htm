lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'> as the junior coach in
February this year. At that stage, there were seven children attending the
club. Unfortunately, two of those were visitors from the </span><span
  lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>UK</span><span
lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'> who immediately
transferred to a nearer club (and then returned to </span><span lang=EN-AU
  style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Britain</span><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'> at the end of the first term). Three
other players did not return after the first night for various reasons, leaving
only two regulars. In Term 2, the club gained two new regular players (</span><span
 lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Cameron</span><span
lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'> and </span><span

  lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Farlow</span><span
lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>) and several other
players from the Gap SS also came for a few weeks. However, our two continuing
players from Term 1 had to move to NSW when their father was employed there at
the end of Term 2. During Term 3, the only regular attendees were the Farlows. They
left at the end of the term, and the club had zero attendance in Term 4. As a
result, I have decided to cease coaching at the Junior Club on November 19th,
and will not be continuing next year. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I
was optimistic when I took over the club, as I have been successful in
improving small attendances at other junior clubs. But I do not believe that I
could now achieve anything more by continuing next year. Attempts to increase
membership (by myself and others) during the year were unsuccessful. I wrote to
all the schools in the vicinity, informing them of the club. And I placed
notices at the nearby Shopping Centre. Neither of these resulted in any new
members. Several parents also publicised the club at their children's schools,
also without success.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>There
has been a general decline in junior clubs in </span><span lang=EN-AU
   style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Brisbane</span><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>. The once flourishing Nundah/Northside
Junior Club has completely disappeared. The Ironside club has continued after
its move to </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Mt</span><span
 lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'> </span><span
  lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Ommaney</span><span
lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>, although with
much-reduced numbers. Only the Southside club has managed to sustain its
numbers. The major problem at the Gap appears to be the lack of feeder schools
nearby. None of the schools has chess coaching (despite the best efforts of
both QSC and Gardiner Chess), and only the Gap SS seems to have a significant
number of junior chess players. Another problem the club has faced has been
plain bad luck, starting with the loss of several juniors due to their parents
moving, and culminating with my broken arm (which required hospitalisation). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>On
the bright side, I have enjoyed coaching the juniors at the club, and it has
cost me relatively little - mainly some wasted time. There has been no cost to
the Gap Chess Club itself, as I was paid purely from my (meagre) earnings. I
believe that it would be possible to revive the junior club, if the Gap Club
can find somebody who is prepared to undertake significant promotional effort
in the Gap area to generate chess activity in the nearby schools, which will then
provide players for the junior club.</span></p>

would like to thank the Gap Chess Club for the opportunity to coach at the
club, and also thank the Farlows for their support. And finally thanks to </span><span
