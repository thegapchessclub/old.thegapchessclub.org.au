<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-family:Arial'>A few of the club's new digital clocks have required
batteries to be replaced throughout the year. Since I put the turn off clock
reminder on the cupboard shelf, none has needed batteries to be replaced. I came
across one clock with a flat 9 volt battery, also earlier in the year.  This
clock needed a 4aa Battery adapter and batteries which Stuart deducted from my
Friday evening fees. The cost of the new batteries for the other clocks was
also deducted from my Friday evening fees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-family:Arial'>Towards the end of the Handicap Lightning Tournament,
Marty had worked out a way to set the digital clocks (which has players' time
limits needing to be adjusted). You could set the digital clocks' time limits
at 5 minutes and then let the time run down. Then press start/stop. I think
this would be a good idea if there is going to be another Handicap Lightning
Tournament.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-family:Arial'>The Chess Boards and Chess Sets have been counted,
missing pieces added to the sets. The analogue clocks have been counted and
checked. Two of the ten remaining BHB clocks are not working, they have been
labelled. Five BHB clocks were sold to Ray Adams on 6 February 2004. The German
clocks are all in good condition. The Magnetic Board and Pieces Set still has 5
broken white pawns. Some other magnetic pieces are not so good, but usable. The
broken urn did not get listed.</span></p>
