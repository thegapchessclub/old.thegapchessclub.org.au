<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:22.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>Tribute
to Harvey Quaresmini </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Centaur'>by Andrew Robinson </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:Centaur'>This tribute was
originally written for </span><span style='font-family:Centaur'>Harvey</span><span
style='font-family:Centaur'>'s funeral on </span><span
 style='font-family:Centaur'>6 May 2009</span><span style='font-family:Centaur'>
and is reproduced here with slight editing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>I have known </span><span lang=EN-AU>Harvey</span><span
lang=EN-AU> since 1993 through our long association with the chess club. </span><span
  lang=EN-AU>Harvey</span><span lang=EN-AU> was an enthusiastic and popular
member of our club, stretching back to 1978 when he first joined. His
contribution to our club has been immense, and his presence which was constant
over three decades will be greatly missed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>His style of play over the chessboard was
very solid and methodical, reflecting his approach towards life. </span><span
  lang=EN-AU>Harvey</span><span lang=EN-AU>'s consistency and reliability made
him a pillar of the club for many years. Attendance at our club fluctuates from
year to year, as it does with most sporting clubs, but even in the leanest
years there were three players we knew we could depend on to always turn up on
a Friday night: Doug Foster, Stuart Wilson, and Harvey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>Harvey</span><span lang=EN-AU>'s kindness,
gentleness (for he was a big man), and his honesty &mdash; almost innocence &mdash; were
qualities that touched us all. Complications in his life took him away from the
game and the companionship that he sought and loved. We probably all expected
that </span><span lang=EN-AU>Harvey</span><span lang=EN-AU> would return to our
chess club one day. And so it is hard to believe now that he will not be walking
though the doors of our chess club again; to play a few games, to share a few
jokes, to discuss the chess scene - past and present. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>His passing has been untimely. Our club
will be poorer, and we will be sadder, for his passing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Centaur'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>
