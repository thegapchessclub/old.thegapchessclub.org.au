additional information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Centaur'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>On
Thursday 16<sup>th</sup> January Doug Foster finally lost the proverbial
endgame with Death. Some of us felt that this was against the run of play over
the last few years, given the characteristically strong defence he had raised.
Thus ended a rich and varied life of 84 years which had seen him leave his
native </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>London</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>, serve in </span><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>North Africa</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'> and the </span><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>Middle East</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'> during WWII, work in </span><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>Southern Rhodesia</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>, and settle down in </span><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>Brisbane</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'> in 1965. Here he eventually
founded his own small business. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>In
December last year, a mere week or two before entering hospital, Doug was representing
The Gap Chess Club in the Qld Teams Championship. He had not been enthusiastic
about taking part, thinking that we would be cannon fodder for the more
powerful and, I suspect, a little concerned about his state of health. But he
turned up &mdash; club loyalty was too strong. For Doug loyalty to the club and to
the state body was important, a value that he had ever sought to inculcate into
the club. Once at the tournament his passion for chess and the essential
vitality and gutsiness of the man took over. It was not enough for him to play
his six games, each of which would probably have taken between half an hour and
an hour &mdash; he seemed to spend the intervals playing social chess. Now let us
remember this was a man in his mid eighties and feeling, as I believe, under a
cloud, yet not all of us younger players could match his mental energy. At
least one of his fellows twenty years his junior felt impelled to rest his
brain and decline Doug's invitation to yet another game. Doug played on of
course, against other opponents. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>Let me
now take you back a decade or two. The Gap CC was faced with a demand for
ruinously increased rent. A vote was taken and Doug and those who wished to
stay on were beaten. However the majority were na√Øve and incautious enough to
allow him another week before the decision was final. Doug used that week to
good effect &mdash; claiming that the parents of members of the junior club had a
vote, he used them to get the numbers he needed (and this despite the fact that
the coaches of the juniors were determined to move). Doug was a terrier who
would not accept defeat. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>In the
aftermath of his victory he showed his characteristic generosity. The core of
the overturned majority left the club to found another in </span><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>St Lucia</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>. And it was Doug who gave them
boards and sets from the club's stores to set them on their feet. And I should
add that such support to a new club was not an isolated incident. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>To speak
a little more generally, throughout the years of our friendship he exhibited a
strong egalitarianism, a feeling that Jack was as good as his master. There
were hints of this in his stories about his life in the Army in WWII but it was
more evident in the policies he espoused in chess. Not for him the argument
that </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>Australia</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>'s chess elite deserved perks and
privileges &mdash; they should pay the same entry fee to tournaments as Joe Blow. He
was a strong defender of amateur principles and fought any attempt to introduce
prizemoney into club tournaments such as the Flood Cup. Similarly he was a
great champion of the handicap principal within the club and secured for some
years an internal handicap tournament with, in theory, all having the same
chance of winning. In the chess world his egalitarianism is perhaps a doomed
value. Doug did much for the chess world without any thought of recompense. He
used his art and artistic talents to provide prizes, to design logos and print
brochure/entry forms and not just for his own club. He served on the committee
of his own club, for many years as president, and in various guises on the
state body. He was also a pioneer in writing chess columns for the free local
papers. In short he was as generous with his time as with his talents. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>It will
come as no surprise to you that Doug was one of the recipients of the medal for
services to chess that the state body distributed on the occasion of the
millennium, and that his club made him a life member. The Gap has named the
club championship trophy after him, a fit tribute to a man who did so much for
the club and played such a role in forming its peculiar culture. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>But of
course Doug was much more than a chess player and it would be wrong of me to
try so to confine his memory. Others may tell you more of his activities in the
fields of music and musical instruments, of cycling, bush walking, bird
watching, and of course screen printing and visual art. But I must encroach on
their turf and recount a story that illustrates the extent of his reputation as
a guitar maker. One night he told me of how a man whom he did not recognise but
is one of the stars of the local radio entertainment scene had called
unannounced at his house and ordered a guitar from him. He had been searching
for a Doug Foster guitar for some time. And such was Doug's reputation and the
quality of his instruments that he had ambitions, as late as last year, of
breaking into the American market. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>Given the
range of his abilities I should not have been surprised, but most certainly
was, when in one of our talks I learned of yet another skill he possessed. Doug
revealed that he had coached one of our acquaintances in fencing. Only at the
funeral service did I learn that he also had an interest in archery and
characteristically had built his own bow. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>In short
Doug was one of the most remarkable men I have met, quite possibly the most
remarkable. He was indomitable, almost indestructible, and in the breadth of
his interests a Renaissance man. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>Personally
of course he was more. He was a friend and we used to enjoy our encounters on
Friday nights when, after the serious games he would ask me whether I was ready
for my chess lesson, and we would play sometimes outrageous games while
carrying on light banter. And after chess we might carry on long conversations
through which I would gain insights into his long and rich life. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>I miss
Doug. But at least we can all savour our memories of a man it was a privilege
to know. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Centaur'>&nbsp;</span></p>
