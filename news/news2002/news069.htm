<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial;color:navy'>Sunday
15 December saw the inaugural </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial;
  color:navy'>Queensland</span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial;
color:navy'> team championship played at the venue of the </span><span
  lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial;color:navy'>Brisbane</span><span
lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial;color:navy'> club. That seven adult teams
of eight boards participated is a tribute to CAQ President Howard Duggan. That
the same admittedly large room held both the adult and junior competitions
without raised voices is a tribute to his wielding of his big stick. What might
the Democrats even now achieve were he their Chief Whip! </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial;color:navy'>The
Gap’s participation had been threatened by the CAQ’s obduracy in refusing to
accept George Flitcroft-Smith as a Gap member (George, who has played in all our
tournaments this year, who first joined the club a century or two ago and who
regularly sacrifices himself to accommodate Andrew’s passion for late night
transfer). However on the morning the CAQ saw sense and we played in both adult
and junior competitions. Some of our stronger players were for various reasons
unavailable but we fielded a full team that played above the expectations of
many. In John Fortin we had a more than credible first board and the lesser
lights pulled their weight. Special mention should be made of the heroes who
met and refuted the Vietnamese Gambit over the board. This opening, flashy yet
subtle, has little written on it – nothing in MCO, and has confounded stronger
than Doug and Peter, yet our players drew on their years of experience and
handled themselves manfully. It will come as no surprise then that while
Redcliffe won the championship from the Gold Coast (the Coast won the juniors),
The Gap won the Moral Victors title, awarded by The Gap team. As all true chess
players know the moral victory is the one that REALLY counts, we may take pride
in being the real champions! (For all doubting Thomases, ignore the faulty
published results and look at the photo that shows us with the trophy). </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span lang=EN-AU>The regular scribe is now talking…</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-AU>It should be noted that Brian believes he
scored 3 wins from 6 on the day, and as the above scores are not totally
reliable, he may have won a game that is credited above to Stuart. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-AU>John Fortin played some great chess
considering he had not played in a tournament for several years since leaving </span><span
  lang=EN-AU>Canada</span><span lang=EN-AU>. Andrew Robinson pulled draws out
of the mouth of victory twice, was outclassed twice, lost a close game to Kerry
Corker, and pulled off a draw against Jonathan Humphries by forcing a rook to
be taken, thus leaving a stalemate position, and rescuing a hopeless position.
George had a good day and managed the club’s only victory against Redcliffe.
Brian played well enough to score 50% according to his own reckoning. Peter recovered after being flummaxed by the VN gambit
in Round One (he claims not to remember anything from the game) to score a win
against Bullwinkle. Doug, Stuart and John all scored the odd win and saved the
club from embarrassment at times. So, all round a very good showing and well
worthy of the Moral Victors’ Trophy which we will be exhibiting at our club
once Redcliffe CC returns it. </span></p>
