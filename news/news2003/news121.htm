<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The Gap CC paid a
return visit to Northside CC tonight at </span><span lang=EN-AU
  style='font-family:Arial'>Nundah</span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:

 lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'> </span><span lang=EN-AU
  style='font-family:Arial'>School</span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:
Arial'>. Northside had managed to win 4-2 at the last meeting when The Gap
fielded an under strength team (see <a href="news093.htm">report 30 May 2003</a>).
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>The first thing
to be decided was the teams, and with Harvey and Brian eligible for both teams
it was left to Northside to choose who they wanted. Amazingly team captain and uberfuhrer
Richard Hixon chose Mr Willcock. </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:
  Arial'>Harvey</span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'> ended up
being paired with Brian Kublik, however Mr Kublik did not appear so </span><span
  lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Harvey</span><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-family:Arial'> ended up playing late comer Steve Quick. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>On board one The
Gap welcomed back John Fortin who had to use all his wile gained over decades
of facing Canadian Grandmasters to wrest a half point off Queensland under 12
champion Daniel Anderson. Daniel actually held the initiative from early on,
and both players missed some half chances, but agreed it was a fair result. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Andrew played Northside
stalwart Col Tapsall on board two. </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:
  Arial'>Col</span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'> had won this
year’s Northside lightning championship and showed why by playing all his moves
in 12 minutes against 35 for his opponent. </span><span lang=EN-AU
  style='font-family:Arial'>Col</span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>
was aided by forgetting his glasses giving his opponent a reason to accede to
his request not to record moves. Black held the initiative in this game after
giving white the worst case of a bad bishop in history (outside the recent
scandals in the church). However black underestimated white’s caution and
failed to capitalise on the advantage (this would never happen in a club
tournament where you know your opponent’s strengths and weaknesses!). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Board three saw
George turn a drawish situation into a win for good against evil and the
slaying of the evil traitor Brian Quisling Willcock. (Writs should be served
before the commencement of the first game. Clocks will not be stopped for this
purpose). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Harvey</span><span
lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'> had an amazingly quick win on board four
against Steve Quick. The quickness was all the more amazing as Mr Quick was
board one for Northside in May, and has won their Hour and Rapid tournaments
this year. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Board six and
seven both lost (James seemed to indicate that he was heroic in defeat, but the
better man on the day had won etc etc). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>This brings us to
the decider – the odd game on board five. Ray got into time trouble and was
consequently flustered. Then he managed to get the better of the endgame and
was about to mate when Richard called stalemate. Ray accepted this at the time,
but then looked at the position again and claimed he was swindled. Richard came
over, saw the final position, and said Ray was right. ‘You win then’ he said.
Everyone seemed happy with this (except Mr Willcock of course!). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>So strictly
according to the rules of chess this should have been 3.5-3.5 perhaps, however
no scoresheet was signed and the players and team captains seemed happy enough
with an Adams victory. So 4-3 to The Gap it was! Victory is ours!! (not wanting
to strike too triumphal a tone in these circumstances…) </span></p>
