<h1><a name=top></a><span lang=EN-AU>Report – </span><span
 lang=EN-AU>3 January 2003</span><span lang=EN-AU> </span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=lightning></a><b><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:
18.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Lightning Tournament </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Just after play
commenced a debate was commenced by Mr Willcock on the interpretation of what
should occur if the king is captured, as has been the custom for many years in
lightning play. One of the world’s most respected arbiters, Guert Gijssen has
written in his column in chesscafe.com that king capture is an illegal move and
should therefore constitute the loss of the game (pursuant to his
interpretation of the current FIDE rules). Debate occurred on this and the
final non-resolution was that we will wait until an incident occurs, and then
make a decision. The club’s DOP noted that most lightning incidents occur about
other issues, and on the night this proved to be so. (Read on…!) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Most of the
results turned out one-sided, however most of the contests were anything but
this. Paul appeared rusty as he was only able to claim a draw from </span><span
  lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Harvey</span><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-family:Arial'>. Andrew looked headed for a 4-0 scoreline against
Brian until using a Willcock special in game 3 (Queen left en pris) – games 1
and 2 had been hard fought. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Most controversy
on the night surrounded the Quaresmini-Fitcroft-Smith encounter. In the first
game </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Harvey</span><span
lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'> claimed a win for an illegal move. George
had captured with a rook moving from d1 to d8 (giving him a 2 rook v bishop
advantage), but </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Harvey</span><span
lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'> thought the rook had been moved from e1,
and complained that George had moved before he had hit the clock (George was in
time trouble). Unfortunately there were no witnesses who would testify and so
the players agreed to replay the game. The replay of Game 1 saw </span><span
  lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Harvey</span><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-family:Arial'> a piece up with George under 30 seconds. At this
point </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Harvey</span><span
lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'> blundered horribly and lost a queen.
George managed to scramble a checkmate with pieced flying, 2 seconds left on
his clock, and </span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Harvey</span><span
lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'> king knocked off the board (</span><span
  lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Harvey</span><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-family:Arial'> replaced it and complained). </span><span
  lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>Harvey</span><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-family:Arial'> was rattled after this and lost the next 3 game. The
final game had Harvey again with an advantage (R+PvB+P) and a few seconds up,
but George’s ‘blustering’ style once again flustered Harvey who missed a simple
chance to get at least a draw by exchanging his rook for the bishop and pawn. </span></p>
