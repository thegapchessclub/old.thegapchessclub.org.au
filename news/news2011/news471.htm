<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Tonight
was supposed to see the finalisation of games from last year’s Allegro and 45
Minute Tournament, however only four keen chess players showed up. So it was a
night of social chess.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Andrew
played Tony in a series of 5 minute games while Jim Petrie played Michael
Stock, a visitor to the club. The games between Andrew and Tony were even with
Andrew just having the edge 4-2 – a good hit out for both players with the club’s
‘blitz season’ upon us. Jim played at a more sedate time control, and announced
in astonishment that his opponent had beaten him despite opposite coloured
bishops. Andrew was beginning to wonder about his question to Michael at the
start: “Can you play with the clock?”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Jim
and Tony left and Andrew and Michael played about a dozen games of blitz.
Michael won about the first six games straight until Andrew was finally able to
break through. After this Andrew had a few missed opportunities, and achieved a
draw in the last game when Michael played a very “experimental opening” but no
further wins. During the games Michael was very focussed, but congenial
afterwards and interesting to talk with. Michael said he was travelling around </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Michael’s
FIDE rating is 2275, so the question “Can you play with the clock?” was
certainly inappropriate, and amusing to consider in retrospect! Michael
considered that the players at our club are certainly stronger than their ACF
ratings would indicate. If the ACF is reading, please note!</span></p>
